This script controls a string of Neopixels connected to Pin 1 on a BBC Microbit. Button A changes colour and Button B changes brightness (from off to full brightness).

It also transmits and receives hue, saturation and luminosity values, allowing a second Microbit to be used as a controller for a lamp, or multiple lamps to synchronise with each other.
